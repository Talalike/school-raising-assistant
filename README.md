# ðŸŽ“ School Raising Assistant (MVP)

**Alba** is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to help teachers and school project creators write compelling crowdfunding campaigns in just a few minutes, based on a few simple inputs.

- Uses a hosted LLM (OpenAI GPT-4o) and lightweight RAG pipeline

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python 3.12.4
- FastAPI
- FAISS + SentenceTransformers
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o)
- Pandas, Loguru
